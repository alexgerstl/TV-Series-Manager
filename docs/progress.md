## Milestone 1 — Foundation

| Task | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1.1 — Project scaffold | **Done** | 2026-07-10 | Electron+React+TS scaffold, ESLint/Prettier/Vitest/electron-builder wired. `typecheck`/`lint`/`test`/`build` all verified clean. Live `npm run dev` window launch manually verified on Windows — confirmed working 2026-07-10 after resolving a local Electron binary install issue (see note below). |
| M1.2 — Database connection + migration runner | **Done** | 2026-07-10 | `better-sqlite3` connection module (WAL + foreign_keys pragmas), migration runner (`schema_migrations` table, per-migration transactions, fail-loud on error, idempotent re-run), placeholder `0001_init.sql`. Wired into `main.ts` startup — halts app on migration failure. 15 unit tests covering fresh-apply, idempotency, partial-new-migration runs, rollback-on-bad-SQL, retry-after-fix, duplicate-version rejection, and non-migration-file filtering. **Post-implementation fix (same day):** dev machine's Node 24 + Node 20 EOL required bumping `better-sqlite3` to v12 and the Node engine target to 22+ (see decisions.md); also hit and fixed an Electron-vs-Node native-module ABI mismatch via `predev`/`prebuild`/`pretest` rebuild hooks (see decisions.md). Verified working end-to-end on the dev machine — `npm run dev` launches cleanly. |
| M1.3 — Core schema migration | **Done** | 2026-07-10 | `0002_core_schema.sql` creates all 7 tables per architecture.md §4.2 (Settings, ManagedSeries, LookupHistory, MKVMetadata, Logs, ToolConfiguration, SyncLog) with all specified indexes. 15 integration tests against the real migration files: table/column shape per table, all indexes present, unique-constraint rejection (ManagedSeries.normalizedName, MKVMetadata.fullPath, ToolConfiguration.name), FK cascade-delete verified functionally (deleting a ManagedSeries row removes its LookupHistory rows), FK rejection of an orphan seriesId, default values (lookupEnabled=1, verified=0), and idempotent re-run at schema version 2. |
| M1.4 — Repository layer skeleton | **Done** | 2026-07-10 | One repository class per entity (`SettingsRepository` get/set/getAll; `ManagedSeriesRepository`, `LookupHistoryRepository`, `MKVMetadataRepository`, `LogsRepository`, `ToolConfigurationRepository`, `SyncLogRepository` each with create/find methods) under `src/main/database/repositories/`, all constructor-injected with a `Database` handle — no raw SQL outside this layer. Row/domain types added under `src/main/models/` (one file per entity, matching architecture.md §3.1's folder layout) and re-exported through `database/index.ts`. 36 unit tests against a real temp SQLite DB (migrated via the actual migration files), covering create/read for every repository plus unique-constraint and FK-rejection behavior already proven at the schema level in M1.3. `typecheck`/`lint`/`test` all clean (66/66 tests passing). |
| M1.5 — Settings Service + safeStorage integration | **Done** | 2026-07-10 | `SettingsService` (`src/main/settings/`) wraps `SettingsRepository` behind `ISettingsService`; generic `get`/`set` round-trip plaintext for non-secret keys. NAS password gets a dedicated encrypted path (`getNasPassword`/`setNasPassword`) via an injected `ISafeStorage` interface (narrow wrapper matching Electron's `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable`/`encryptString`/`decryptString`, DI'd so the service is unit-testable under plain Node/Vitest without a real Electron runtime — production wiring to Electron's real `safeStorage` deferred to whichever task first consumes it, e.g. M6.2). Ciphertext is base64-encoded into the `TEXT` value column. The reserved `nasPassword` key is hard-blocked from the generic `get`/`set` path (throws), so the "never plaintext" guarantee can't be bypassed by accident. 10 unit tests: plaintext round-trip asserted directly against raw DB bytes; NAS password round-trip; raw-DB-bytes assertion proving the stored value is neither the plaintext nor a containing substring of it, and matches `safeStorage.encryptString` exactly; safeStorage-unavailable failure path; reserved-key guard on both `get` and `set`. |
| M1.6 — Logging Service | **Done** | 2026-07-10 | `LoggingService` (`src/main/logging/`) writes structured entries to the `Logs` table via `LogsRepository` and a console sink, one method per level (`debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`). Console sink is behind an injected `IConsoleSink` interface — real implementation (`createPinoConsoleSink`) wraps `pino` (added as a new dependency, `^9.14.0`, per architecture.md §2/§3.1), fake implementation used in tests so no service code depends on pino directly. Redaction rule (architecture.md §6): a pure `redact()` function recursively replaces the value of any object key matching `password`/`credential` (case-insensitive substring) with `[REDACTED]` before a log call's context is serialized into the persisted `message` — applied identically to both the DB write and the console sink. `error()` accepts the causing error separately and stores its stack (or `String(value)` for non-`Error` throws) in the `exception` column. 19 unit tests: 7 for `redact()` in isolation (top-level/case-insensitive/substring/nested/array-nested/non-sensitive-passthrough/primitive-passthrough), 12 for `LoggingService` against a real temp SQLite DB — level/source/message/timestamp persistence, exception population, console-sink mirroring, and the redaction-in-persisted-message guarantee explicitly (including nested-field and console-sink cases). |
| M1.7 — IPC contract scaffolding + shared error types | **Done** | 2026-07-10 | `ErrorCode` enum (`src/shared/errors/`) with the §5.5-named domain codes plus two boundary codes (`VALIDATION_FAILED`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`). `IpcResult<T>` envelope + `ok`/`fail` helpers (`src/shared/ipc-contracts/IpcResult.ts`). `settings:get`/`settings:set` contracts (`src/shared/ipc-contracts/settings.ts`) — `zod` schemas as the single source of truth, with request types derived via `z.infer` so type and runtime validator can't drift. Generic `registerIpcHandler` pattern (`src/main/ipc/`) validates every request against its schema before the handler runs, logs full detail via `LoggingService` on both validation failure and thrown errors, and always returns the sanitized `IpcResult` envelope — `ipcMain` itself is injected behind a narrow `IIpcMain` interface (same DI pattern as `ISafeStorage`/`IConsoleSink`) so the pattern is unit-testable without a real Electron runtime. `registerSettingsHandlers` wires the one example channel pair to `SettingsService`. Preload (`src/preload/index.ts`) now exposes `window.api.settings.get/set`, returning the raw `IpcResult` envelope. `main.ts` composition root wired up: constructs `LoggingService`/`SettingsService`/real `safeStorage`, registers the settings handlers — this also closed out the M1.2-flagged tech debt of `main.ts` using `console.log` as a LoggingService placeholder (the DB-init-failure branch necessarily still uses `console.error`, since there's no Logs table to write to if migrations themselves failed). Added `zod` (request validation) and `@playwright/test` (E2E) as new dependencies — Playwright installed with `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` since Electron mode drives the already-installed Electron binary directly and needs no Chromium/Firefox/WebKit download. New `playwright.config.ts` + `tests/e2e/settingsRoundTrip.spec.ts`: launches the real built app (`dist/main/main.js`) via Playwright's `_electron` driver and drives `window.api.settings` exactly as real renderer code will, covering the round trip, an unset-key `null` case, and a validation-rejection case — satisfying the M1.7 Definition of Done. New `test:e2e` script (`pretest:e2e` runs `npm run build` first, matching this project's existing `pre<script>` hook convention from M1.2). 26 new unit tests (`ErrorCode`/`IpcResult`/schema/`registerIpcHandler`/`settingsHandlers`) plus the 4 Playwright E2E tests. **Environment-specific fix required for the E2E test only:** this dev machine's shell has `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` set (used elsewhere for native-module ABI checks without a GUI, per the M1.2 tech-debt notes) — inherited by a naively-spawned Electron child process, it makes the binary run as plain Node instead of full Electron, leaving `electron.app` undefined. The E2E spec explicitly strips this var from the spawned process's env. |
| M1.8 — Empty tab shell UI | **Done** | 2026-07-10 | `App.tsx` now renders the real six-tab shell (Monitor/Lookup/NAS Sync/Tools/Settings/Logs, SRS §20 order) using MUI v6 `Tabs`/`Tab` inside a `ThemeProvider`+`CssBaseline`, replacing the M1.1 placeholder. Each tab is a standalone placeholder page component (`src/renderer/pages/*.tsx`) with a heading and a note on which future milestone builds it out (M2.4/M7/M6/M5/M8.1/M8.3 respectively). First Zustand slice (`src/renderer/store/uiStore.ts`) holds `activeTab`, driving which page renders — the "Zustand store skeleton" this task calls for. Added `@mui/material` (pinned to `^6.5.0` per architecture.md §2's tech stack — a bare `npm install` initially pulled v9, corrected), `@emotion/react`/`@emotion/styled` (MUI's required style-engine peers), and `@testing-library/react`/`@testing-library/jest-dom`/`jsdom` (RTL smoke-test tooling) as new dependencies. `vitest.config.ts` updated: added the `@vitejs/plugin-react` plugin (already a devDependency, used by `electron.vite.config.ts`) so `.tsx` files transform correctly, and widened `include` to pick up `.test.tsx`. `tsconfig.eslint.json` gained `"jsx": "react-jsx"` and a `tests/**/*.tsx` include so the new RTL test files type-check under lint. 15 new unit tests: one RTL smoke test per page component (6, satisfying the M1.8 Definition of Done literally), a `uiStore` behavior test (default tab, `setActiveTab`, tab-list contents), and an `App`-level test covering the acceptance criteria directly — all six tabs render, zero `console.error` calls, and clicking each tab renders its corresponding page. Each RTL test file explicitly calls `@testing-library/react`'s `cleanup()` in `afterEach` (Vitest isn't configured with `test.globals: true`, so RTL's automatic Jest-global-detected cleanup doesn't engage — caught by a genuine multi-render DOM-pollution test failure before the fix). Verified beyond the unit suite: `npm run build` succeeds with the heavier renderer bundle (MUI pulls the renderer to ~944 modules / ~506 kB, still builds instantly), and the existing M1.7 Playwright E2E suite (which loads the full renderer through a real Electron window) still passes 4/4 against the new UI. |

## Known Technical Debt / Open Follow-ups

Carried forward from completed tasks — resolve opportunistically or dedicate cleanup time before M9.

- **From M1.1:** `import/no-default-export` set to `warn` (not `error`) with `.tsx` exempted — revisit once more of the codebase exists.
- **From M1.1:** `docs/` folder in the scaffold is currently empty — SRS/decisions.md/architecture.md not yet copied in.
- **From M1.1:** `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` required `--legacy-peer-deps` to install due to an ESLint 8/9 peer-range mismatch upstream. Lint runs clean; flagging in case this conflicts with a stricter dependency policy later.
- **Resolved 2026-07-10:** Local `npm install` on the dev machine did not download the Electron binary (postinstall's `@electron/get` step failed silently — `ignore-scripts` was `false`, so likely a network/firewall restriction on GitHub release downloads specifically, since general npm registry access worked fine). Worked around by manually downloading `electron-v31.2.0-win32-x64.zip`, extracting it flat into `node_modules\electron\dist\`, and writing `node_modules\electron\dist\path.txt` containing exactly `electron.exe` (no trailing CRLF — `echo` on Windows appends one and breaks the spawn call with an `ENOENT` on a literal `electron.exe\r\n` path; use `Set-Content -NoNewline` instead). `npm run dev` now launches correctly. **Follow-up:** if this recurs on a clean setup or CI machine, the root network restriction should be diagnosed/allow-listed rather than repeating the manual workaround each time — worth a line in the README setup instructions once M8.4 (packaging) is reached.
- **Resolved 2026-07-10 (M1.7):** `main.ts` logged database startup/failure via `console.log`/`console.error` as a deliberate M1.2-era placeholder. Now uses `LoggingService` for the success path; the migration-*failure* branch still necessarily uses `console.error` (there's no working `Logs` table to write to if migrations themselves just failed).
- **Resolved 2026-07-10:** `better-sqlite3@11.10.0` had no prebuilt binary for Node 24 (dev machine's runtime), which made `npm install` fall back to source compilation requiring Python/node-gyp. Root cause: `architecture.md` was pinned to Node 20 LTS, which reached EOL in April 2026. Fixed by bumping `better-sqlite3` to `^12.11.1` (Node 24 prebuild support) and the `engines.node` target to `>=22.0.0`; `architecture.md` §2 updated accordingly. Logged as a dated decision in `decisions.md`.
- **Resolved 2026-07-10:** After the above fix, the `better-sqlite3` native binary still failed to load inside the actual Electron app with `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` / NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch — Electron embeds its own Node/V8 build with a different ABI than the system Node.js used by Vitest. Fixed by adding `@electron/rebuild` and wiring `predev`/`prebuild` → rebuild for Electron's ABI, `pretest` → rebuild for plain Node's ABI, via npm's automatic `pre<script>` hooks. Verified both directions round-trip cleanly (tests pass after `pretest`, app loads the module correctly after `predev`/`prebuild`, confirmed via `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`). Logged in `decisions.md`; **follow-up for future tasks:** any new native (main-process-only) dependency will need the same `-w <package>` treatment added to these three scripts.
- **From M1.7:** this dev machine's shell has `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` set persistently (the same variable used above to verify module loading without a GUI). A naively-spawned Electron child process inherits it and runs as plain Node instead of full Electron, leaving `electron.app`/`ipcMain`/etc. undefined — this broke the first `_electron.launch()` attempt in `tests/e2e/settingsRoundTrip.spec.ts` with a confusing "Process failed to launch!" error. Fixed locally by stripping the var from the env passed to `electron.launch()`. **Follow-up:** any future Playwright Electron spec must do the same (strip `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` from the launch `env`), or factor this into a shared E2E test helper once more than one E2E spec exists.
